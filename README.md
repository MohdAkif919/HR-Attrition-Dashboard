# Project Overview
During my Internship at MeriSKILL as a Data Analyst, I developed a comprehensive HR Attrition Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard consists of five interconnected pages, with a central Home Page acting as a navigational hub to four detailed sections: Demographic, Employee Wellness, Turnover Analysis - I, and Turnover Analysis - II.
